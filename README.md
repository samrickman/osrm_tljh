Scripts to install OSRM and TLJH on Ubuntu 18.04

This script is to install [OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend) and [TLJH](http://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/amazon.html) on a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 AWS instance.

This repo contains two scripts. The first is to be run after sshing into the instance. The second is to be run from a terminal within the JupyterHub environment.
